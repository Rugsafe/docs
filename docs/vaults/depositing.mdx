# Depositing

Depositing tokens into a vault is a fundamental operation in the vault system. This process allows users to store assets securely while interacting with the protocol.

## Overview of Depositing

Depositing tokens into a vault involves transferring a specific amount of tokens from the user to the vault. During this process, the system ensures that the user’s tokens are securely held within the vault while maintaining accurate records of the transaction.

### Key Concepts

- **Token Transfer**: The core of depositing revolves around transferring tokens from the user’s account to the vault. This ensures the user’s assets are securely locked within the vault for future use.
  
- **Token Validation**: Before tokens are deposited, validation steps are performed to ensure the tokens match the expected mint type and ownership, preventing errors and ensuring compatibility.

- **Ownership Confirmation**: While anyone can deposit tokens into the vault, the protocol verifies that the deposited tokens are indeed of the type accepted by the vault, safeguarding it from unauthorized access or errors.

## Steps Involved in Depositing

Depositing tokens into a vault follows a well-structured process that ensures proper handling of user assets.

### 1. Token Account Verification

Before depositing, the user’s token account is verified to ensure it holds the correct type of token. This includes matching the token mint with the vault’s expected asset.

### 2. Transfer of Tokens

Once the user’s account is verified, the specified amount of tokens is transferred from the user to the vault. This step secures the assets inside the vault, allowing for future interactions such as withdrawals or conversions.

### 3. Anticoin Minting

Upon depositing rugged tokens, the protocol automatically mints an equal amount of anticoins as receipts. This means:

- **Anticoin Generation**: For every token deposited, a corresponding anticoin is minted, which serves as proof of the user's stake in the vault. This is a critical mechanism ensuring that users receive a clean representation of their original tokens.

- **Value Relation**: The anticoins are inversely pegged to the price movement of the underlying rugged token, providing users with a protective hedge against further depreciation of their assets.

## Security in Depositing

To maintain the integrity of the protocol, multiple security checks are in place during the depositing process:

- **Vault Token Acceptance**: Each vault is designed to accept only one specific type of token. Users can only deposit tokens that match the vault’s accepted asset type.

- **Anticoin Requirement for Withdrawal**: Users can only withdraw from the vault if they possess the corresponding anticoins issued for that vault, ensuring that withdrawals are tied directly to deposits.

## Summary

Depositing tokens into a vault is a straightforward yet secure process. By verifying token ownership, enforcing vault-specific token acceptance, and requiring anticoins for withdrawals, the protocol ensures that assets are safely stored in the vault for future interactions while generating the necessary anticoins to represent the user's holdings.
