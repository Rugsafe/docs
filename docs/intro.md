## Abstract

RugSafe introduces a novel protocol designed to mitigate the risks associated with rug pulls in decentralized finance (DeFi). By leveraging cryptographic primitives and economic incentives, RugSafe provides a framework that ensures the security and recoverability of assets when fraudulent activities are detected. The protocol is built around the concept of vaults, where rugged tokens are securely stored, and an incentive mechanism that mitigates losses and rewards users based on their interaction with the system. RugSafe integrates seamlessly with existing DeFi platforms, offering an additional layer of security without compromising the decentralization principles.
