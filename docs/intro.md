## Abstract

RugSafe introduces a novel protocol designed to mitigate the risks associated with rug pulls in decentralized finance (DeFi). By leveraging cryptographic primitives and economic incentives, RugSafe provides a framework that ensures the security and recoverability of assets when fraudulent activities are detected. The protocol is built around the concept of vaults, where rugged tokens are securely stored, and an incentive mechanism that mitigates losses and rewards users based on their interaction with the system. RugSafe integrates seamlessly with existing DeFi platforms, offering an additional layer of security without compromising the decentralization principles.

## 1. Overview

The RugSafe protocol enables users who hold rugged tokens, denoted as \( C_r \), to deposit these tokens into a specialized vault \( V_r \) and receive an equal amount of antitokens \( C_a \), which are pegged to the inverse price movement of \( C_r \).

### 1.1 Vault Creation and Anticoin Issuance

When a vault \( V_r \) is created for a rugged token \( C_r \), users can deposit \( C_r \) into this vault. Upon deposit, the protocol mints an equal amount of \( C_a \) which is credited to the user's balance.

\[
C_a = C_r
\]

The vaults are held in a secured vault structure governed by smart contracts, ensuring that all deposited assets are protected and managed according to the protocol's rules. This approach helps users mitigate their exposure to fraudulent activities by providing a mechanism to recover or hedge their losses effectively.
