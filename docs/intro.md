## Abstract

Rugsafe introduces a comprehensive protocol aimed at mitigating the
risks of rug pulls in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By utilizing cryptographic security measures and economic incentives, the protocol provides a secure multichain system for recovering assets and transforming
rugged tokens into opportunities and rewards. Foundational to Rugsafe
are specialized vaults where rugged tokens can be securely deposited, and
anticoin tokens are issued as receipts. These anticoins are designed to
be inversely pegged to the price movement of the underlying rugged token. Users can utilize these anticoins within the ecosystem or choose to
burn them, further securing the protocol and earning additional rewards.
The supply of the native Rugsafe token is dynamically adjusted based on
the volume, value, and activity of rugged tokens, ensuring stability and
resilience. By depositing rugged tokens into a vault on several chains,
and by burning anticoins, users receive incentives on the RugSafe chain.
This protocolâ€™s vaults are designed to work in heterogenous blockchain
ecosystems, offering a practical and effective solution to one of the most
significant challenges in the cryptocurrency market.
