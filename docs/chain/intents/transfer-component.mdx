# Transfer Components

## How Token Transfers Are Structured Within Intents

Transfer components are used to define token movements within an intent (will). They specify the sender, recipient, and the amount of tokens to be transferred when the will is executed.

### Structure of a Transfer Component

The key attributes for a transfer component include:
- **From**: The address of the sender (usually the creator of the will).
- **To**: The address of the recipient (beneficiary of the will).
- **Amount**: The specific token amount to transfer.

The intent specifies these fields upon creation and stores them in the willâ€™s components.

### Example: Transferring Tokens to a Beneficiary

When the will is executed, the system checks for any transfer components and proceeds to move tokens accordingly. This occurs automatically based on the logic in the `ExecuteTransfer` function within the keeper.

```go
func (k *Keeper) ExecuteTransfer(ctx sdk.Context, component *types.ExecutionComponent, will types.Will) error {
    coins := sdk.NewCoins(*component.Transfer.Amount)

    fromAddr, err := sdk.AccAddressFromBech32(will.Creator)
    toAddr, err := sdk.AccAddressFromBech32(component.Transfer.To)

    if err := k.bankKeeper.SendCoins(ctx, fromAddr, toAddr, coins); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to send coins: %w", err)
    }
    return nil
}
```

This process ensures that token transfers occur seamlessly as part of the execution of the will, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
