# Will Module Overview

The Will Module is central to the functionality of Rugsafe's chain. It handles the creation, execution, and claiming of intents, which are managed as components. Each intent is composed of various elements, such as execution components, token transfers, contract calls, IBC messages, and claims.

The key functionalities provided by the Will Module are:

- Managing intents and their associated components.
- Handling the lifecycle of intents, from creation to execution and expiration.
- Verifying and processing claims for each intent component using access control and signature verification methods.

The following sections will guide you through the implementation and functionality of the Will Module, showing how intents (formerly referred to as wills) are created, managed, and processed on Rugsafeâ€™s chain.
