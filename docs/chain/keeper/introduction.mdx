# Keeper Overview

## Role of the Keeper in Rugsafe's Chain

The **Keeper** is the module's interface for handling on-chain state and managing intents (wills). It interacts with other parts of the chain, such as the `KVStore`, to persist and retrieve data. The Keeper also performs essential functions such as executing intents, managing claims, and verifying access to components.

Key responsibilities of the Keeper:
- Storing and retrieving intents
- Managing the state and lifecycle of intents
- Handling the execution of components (e.g., transfers, contract calls, IBC sends)
- Managing intent expiration and ensuring correct execution at specific block heights

### Key Keeper Functions

- **CreateWill**: Handles the creation of intents, verifies validity, and stores the intent in the module's state.

```go
func (k *Keeper) CreateWill(ctx context.Context, msg *types.MsgCreateWillRequest) (*types.Will, error) {
    store := k.storeService.OpenKVStore(ctx)

    // Verify block height and ensure will can be created
    if sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(ctx).BlockHeight() > msg.Height {
        return nil, errors.Wrapf(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest, "block height too high")
    }

    ...

    return &will, nil
}
```

- **Claim**: Processes a claim on a will component, verifies it, and marks the component as claimed if valid.

- **ExecuteContract**: Executes a contract call when a will reaches its target block height.

The Keeper is responsible for securely managing intents and ensuring their correct execution as per the logic defined in the module.
