# Managing Positions

In perpetual contracts, positions represent a user's leveraged stake in a market. The **Processor** in Solana handles the lifecycle of these positions through various instructions, such as opening, adding collateral, removing collateral, and ultimately closing or liquidating positions. Let's break down the key operations involved.

## Opening a Position

When a user opens a position, several important tasks are performed, including:

- Creating the **user positions** account (PDA) if it doesn't already exist.
- Creating the **custody account** for holding collateral.
- Storing the position in a **position PDA** that is specific to the user and position index.

This process ensures that every position is securely managed and tracked on-chain.

```rust title="Open Position Instruction"
match instruction {
    PerpetualsInstruction::OpenPosition { side, amount } => {
        Self::process_open_position(program_id, accounts, side, amount)
    }
}
```

### Key Accounts for Opening a Position

The process requires several accounts, including:

- **Payer Account**: The user who opens the position, providing collateral.
- **User Positions Account (PDA)**: Keeps track of the user's positions.
- **Custody Account (PDA)**: Holds the collateral securely.
- **Collateral Mint Account**: The mint for the collateral token.
- **Position Account (PDA)**: Stores data about the specific position.

### Custody Account

The custody account is where collateral is stored. If the custody account does not already exist, it is created and initialized:

```text title="Custody Account Creation"
if custody_account.lamports() == 0 {
    invoke_signed(
        &solana_program::system_instruction::create_account(
            payer_account.key,
            custody_account.key,
            required_lamports,
            spl_token::state::Account::LEN as u64,
            &spl_token::id(),
        ),
        &[payer_account.clone(), custody_account.clone(), system_program.clone()],
        &[&[b"custody", payer_account.key.as_ref(), &[custody_bump]]],
    )?;
}
```

The **custody account** is created using the system instruction, and the program's PDA is used as the authority for this account. This ensures that collateral is securely held by the program itself.

### Position PDA

Each position is identified by a **PDA (Program-Derived Address)**, which is derived based on the user's public key and the index of the position in their user positions account. This ensures that each position is unique:

```text title="Position PDA Derivation"
let (position_pda, position_bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(
    &[b"position", payer_account.key.as_ref(), &user_positions.next_position_idx.to_le_bytes()],
    program_id,
);
```

If the position account doesn't exist, it is created similarly to the custody account.

### Storing the Position

Once all accounts are set up, the position is stored on-chain. This involves serializing the **Position** struct and writing it to the position account:

```text title="Position Struct Serialization"
let position = Position {
    owner: *payer_account.key,
    side,
    size_usd: amount,
    open_time: Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp,
    update_time: Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp,
    ..Position::default()
};

let mut position_data = position_account.try_borrow_mut_data()?;
position.serialize(&mut *position_data)?;
```

The position contains critical information, including the owner, side (long or short), size, and timestamps for when it was opened and last updated.

### Collateral Transfer

The final step in opening a position is transferring the collateral from the user's account to the custody account:

```text title="Collateral Transfer"
let transfer_ix = spl_token::instruction::transfer(
    spl_account.key,
    user_collateral_account.key,
    custody_account.key,
    payer_account.key,
    &[],
    amount,
)?;

invoke(
    &transfer_ix,
    &[
        user_collateral_account.clone(),
        custody_account.clone(),
        payer_account.clone(),
        spl_account.clone(),
    ],
)?;
```

This ensures that the user's collateral is safely transferred to the custody account, securing the position.

## Adding Collateral

Users can add more collateral to an existing position, which involves checking the position's validity and transferring additional collateral to the custody account:

```text title="Add Collateral Instruction"
PerpetualsInstruction::AddCollateral { position_id, amount } => {
    Self::process_add_collateral(program_id, accounts, position_id, amount)
}
```

## Removing Collateral

Similarly, users can remove collateral from a position, provided that enough collateral remains to keep the position secure:

```text title="Remove Collateral Instruction"
PerpetualsInstruction::RemoveCollateral { position_id, amount } => {
    Self::process_remove_collateral(program_id, accounts, position_id, amount)
}
```

## Closing a Position

When a user is ready to close their position, the position's collateral is returned, and the position data is cleared from the PDA:

```text title="Close Position Instruction"
PerpetualsInstruction::ClosePosition { position_id } => {
    Self::process_close_position(program_id, accounts, position_id)
}
```

Closing a position involves calculating profit or loss and adjusting the user's balance accordingly.

## Summary

Opening and managing positions in perpetual contracts requires precise handling of multiple accounts and secure custody of user collateral. The position lifecycle — from opening to closing — ensures that users can engage in leveraged trading while maintaining security and transparency.
